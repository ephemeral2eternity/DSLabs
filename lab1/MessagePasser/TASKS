1. Use object Factory design pattern to design subclass of Logical Clock Service.
2. Use object Factory design pattern to design subclass of Vector Clock Service.
   2.1 Determine the VectorClock size based on the number of names in config file.
3. Develop a "TimeStampedMessage" subclass.
   3.1 Change the Message class to TimeStampedMessage class to include a field of a "TimeStamp" class.
4. Change application code to enable timestamp.
   4.1 All message transmission and reception can be automatically timestamped. Add a method for timestamp, and add it to send and receive method.
5. Centralized Logging facility, "Logger".
   5.1 Inspect Module of timestamps which is on logging facility.
   5.2 Module of identify concurrent messages.
   5.3 Question: does "Logging" count as an event?
   5.4 Single time logger's output: which means we need to invoke logger at some time point.


Most Important: we need to design a testing scenario with delay, drop, and duplicate messages first.
